# Atonement Crystals

Atonement Crystals are an item created to make players whole if and when bugs are found in the leveling process that impact Hero stat gains. Atonement Crystals are provided by airdrop to players who owned impacted Heroes the time that they were leveled, even if that Hero has since been sold or transferred.

Below is a summary of the Atonement Crystals that have been issued to date.

### Atonement Crystal

The Atonement Crystal will provide a +35 bonus to HP and +10 bonus to MP to any Hero that uses it while leveling up. This type of crystal can only be used once per Hero. It is awarded to players who leveled up Heroes between December 8, 2021 and December 10, 2021, when a bug fix was pushed for an issue that guaranteed only small HP and MP gains. These items were airdropped on 2/2/2022.

### Lesser Atonement Crystal

The Lesser Atonement Crystal will provide a +15 bonus to HP to any Hero that uses it while leveling up. This type of crystal can only be used once per Hero. It is awarded to players who leveled up their Heroes between December 10, 2021 and December 30, 2021 _and_ received the regular HP bonus prior to a bug fix for an issue where the HP bonus acquired from VIT was being improperly calculated. These items were airdropped on 2/2/2022.

### Greater Atonement Crystal

The Greater Atonement Crystal is used while leveling up and only one may be used per hero. It provides a +1 bonus to two different random stats, and +1% to the primary growth values and +2% to the secondary growth values of those two selected stats. As a one-time reward, these items were airdropped on 2/7/22 to participants in the DFK Transaction Tracker bounty.
