# Professions

![Professions Zone](../.gitbook/assets/jewel-icon.png)

Resources found from profession quests have various purposes. For example, some fish can be used to produce potions to use in adventure quests. Other things, such as pet eggs, can be used to hatch a pet companion (NFT). Generally, all things can be sold for gold, which can then be used to buy certain items. Some of these features will not be available immediately, but once they are you will be glad that you held on to that Sailfish or Silverfin!


### Mining (MIN)

Mining requires strength and endurance to excel at the art. It is hard manual labor, but that labor pays off. Visit the JEWEL mines to find JEWELs that were locked under the surface, or pay a visit to the gold mine if it please. Increasing a hero’s Mining skill increases the yields a hero will receive.

Mining is a passive activity that you send heroes to do. One hero can visit a mine at a time. For each 10 minutes a hero spends mining, 1 stamina is consumed. When the player stops the hero’s mining action, they will receive rewards based on the amount of stamina spent. Along with JEWELs or Gold, some have been known to find rarer treasures in these mines...


### Gardening (GRD)

Gardening requires the wisdom to give plants time to grow, and plants seem to respond better to those with great vitality. Gardening is primarily done within one’s own Garden, which helps speed the growth of the JEWEL plants, but visiting any garden and putting in some time can still result in some useful harvests. Increasing a hero’s gardening skill can lead to more JEWEL rewards and higher chances to find other resources.

### Foraging (FOR)

Foraging involves clambering over fallen trees in search of useful foliage. It takes dexterity to be a good clamberist, and it takes intelligence to pick out the useful plants from the rabble. Take a stroll out into the woods and see what you find! Increasing foraging improves the chance to find useful items.

Foraging consumes 5 stamina after a brief period of time spent foraging (~15 seconds). A hero can continue taking on foraging quests for as long as they have the stamina.


### Fishing (FSH)

Fishing is equal parts waiting and quickly responding when you feel a lucky bite. Those with agile hands and healthy luck will find their buckets full of fish. Do you have what it takes? Increasing fishing improves the chances to catch better fish.

Fishing consumes 5 stamina after a brief period of time spent fishing (~15 seconds). A hero can continue taking on fishing quests for as long as they have the stamina.
