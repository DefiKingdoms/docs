# Summoning

![Summoning Portal (work in progress)](https://dfk-hv.b-cdn.net/art-assets/portal.gif)

To summon, two heroes must visit the **Arch Druid** and infuse a summoning crystal with their combined essence. **Infused crystals** are then used at the portal to seek heroes from far away lands that are in tune with the heroes that infused the crystal.

To infuse a crystal, heroes pour their energy into **Gaia’s Tears** and **JEWELs**, which are then fed into a summoning crystal. Stronger heroes may use additional Gaia’s Tears to cause the portal to seek stronger heroes more like the summoner. 

For every 5 levels a summoning hero has reached, they may increase the tear cost by 1 oz. to provide bonuses to the summoned hero. Those bonuses are applied to the summoned hero’s stats, Primary Stat Growth, and Secondary Stat Growth. The bonuses are based on the summoning hero’s top three stats, and each summoning hero may provide their own bonuses if they use extra tears.

**Enhancement stones** can also be used during this process to further improve the starting parameters of the summoned hero!

The act of summoning is an exhausting process, and that exhaustion compounds with each act of summoning. For each summon a hero performs, they must wait for a **cooldown period** before they can summon again. The cooldown period increases by four hours with each summon, up to a maximum limit. The base cooldown period is 4*summonerGeneration hours. In addition, with the exception of Gen0 heroes, all new summoned heroes have a 24 hour cooldown period before they can summon. 

The exhaustion of summoning doesn’t end at just a cooldown. The amount of JEWELs needed to infuse the next summoning crystal also increases by 2 JEWELs after each summon. Gen0 heroes have the lowest starting cost for summoning, and each generation above 0 will see an increase in cost for their summons compared to lower generations. The gen0 increase in cost per summon will eventually cap at a price that is lower than what later generations will pay to perform their final summon.

What’s this? Yes, unfortunately only Gen0 heroes are able to maintain their attunement to Gaia summon after summon. All later generations simply have a limit to how many times they can focus their energies into Gaia’s tears. Once they have expended the last of their attunement energies, they can no longer summon. Another quirk of the summoning process is that the portal seeks those who have similar Gaia attunement strength as the weakest summoner. So if a gen0 summoner hero infuses a crystal with a gen1 summoner hero with only four remaining summons worth of attunement, then the summoned gen2 will only be able to summon three times. Two gen0 summoners will summon a gen1 with ten summons worth of attunement. Rumors say that some more advanced heroes have additional limitations when it comes to summoning, though none have been found to discover what those limits might be...
