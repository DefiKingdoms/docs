# Gardening

Gardening Quests can be performed by one Hero at a time in each of the incentivized pools listed in the Seed Box in the Gardens. The quest is begun in the Professions area by speaking to the Gardener, Druid Lam. Heroes may Garden in any of the available Gardens, but JEWEL rewards are only available from those in which the player has seeds, and the JEWEL yield increases with the number of seeds planted by that player in that particular garden. However, the Gardening quest has a chance to reward with plants, Gaia's Tears, ShvƒÅs runes, and Green Eggs whether the player has seeds in the garden or not.

The Level 0 Gardening quest is being launched with a special multiplier to increase its rewards yield for a limited time. This multiplier will decrease over a period of 16 weeks until the quest settles at the intended yield formula. Gardening yields rely heavily on both the player's share of the liquidity pools that their Heroes will work in and on the overall balance of the Quest Rewards wallet, so there will be both a large variance in yields between players and pools and a variance in yields over time as the Quest Rewards pool grows or shrinks.

Level 0 rewards formula:&#x20;

earnRate (per tick) = launchBonus\*(rewardPool\*poolAllocation_\*_LPowned\*(0.1+(WIS+VIT)/1222.22+(GrdSkl)/244.44))/(43,200-(7200\*geneBonus))&#x20;

rewardPool - This is the balance of the quest pool wallet.&#x20;

poolAllocation - This is the percent of allocation a specific garden has (the allocation for JEWEL distribution).&#x20;

LPowned - The percent of the liquidity pool that the player owns in the selected Garden.&#x20;

GrdSkl - A hero's Gardening skill (only counts integer value (1.9 GrdSkl will have same result as 1.0 GrdSkl).&#x20;

geneBonus - Provides a 20% bonus to JEWEL returns, increases the chances of finding tears and runes, and decreases the amount of time per tick from 12 minutes to 10 minutes. These bonuses are only present if the hero has the gardening gene. If they have the gene, geneBonus = 1, if not, geneBonus = 0.&#x20;

launchBonus - A special multiplier applied at launch that will start at 5 at launch, and decrease by 0.5 every two weeks until the value is 1.
