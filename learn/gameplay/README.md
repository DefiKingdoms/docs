# Gameplay

Much of the gameplay in DeFi Kingdoms is centered around Heroes, the utility-based NFTs that can gather resources with [Professions](professions/) and will eventually be able to participate in combat quests and even PVP. You can visit the [Tavern](tavern.md) to buy Heroes and you can learn more about what makes each Hero unique in the [Heroes](heroes/) section of this guide.

If you don't have enough JEWEL yet to purchase a Hero, that's ok, too! You can invest what you do have through the [Bank](bank.md) (DEX fee sharing) or in the Gardens (liquidity pooling) to begin earning more JEWEL.&#x20;

The possibilities for gameplay and earning in DeFi Kingdoms are many and varied, so don't hesitate to explore this guide further to learn more about the options available to you!
