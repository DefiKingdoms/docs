# Power Tokens

### JEWEL

When DeFi Kingdoms: Serendale launched on Harmony, the JEWEL token launched alongside it. Unlike the average crypto token, JEWEL acts as the main token of value in a metaverse game, giving it utility above and beyond that of a regular coin. JEWEL can be used to purchase Hero NFTs, which can themselves be used to earn JEWEL and other rewards. JEWEL can also be combined with existing Heroes and other items to mint new Heroes, and be swapped through the DEX for in-game currency or directly for in-game items. This is all in addition to fee sharing opportunities, liquidity pooling, and [governance rights.](broken-reference)

### CRYSTAL

With the expansion of DeFi Kingdoms: Crystalvale onto the DFK Chain, a new token to power that realm was needed. CRYSTAL fills the same roles that JEWEL does, but within Crystalvale. It can be spent to purchase and mint Hero NFTs, swapped on the in-game DEX, staked for fee sharing, pooled for liquidity, and applied to applicable [governance votes](broken-reference). The total supply of CRYSTAL is one-fourth that of JEWEL, and the issuance schedule is adjusted accordingly.&#x20;

### Transactions & Rewards

The JEWEL or CRYSTAL from every in-game transaction is apportioned as follows:

* 1% - Burned&#x20;
* 10% - Sent to the Bank to reward xJEWEL/xCRYSTAL holders&#x20;
* 30% - Sent to the Quest Rewards Fund&#x20;
* 25% - Sent to the Development Fund, to pay for future game development and bounties&#x20;
* 17% - Sent to the Marketing Fund, to pay for advertising, airdrops, etc&#x20;
* 17% - Sent to the Founders Fund, used to pay milestone bonuses to the dev team

JEWEL and CRYSTAL are the lifeblood of our project and will allow players to earn while playing rather than buying games and subscriptions with no potential to recoup that investment. In DeFi Kingdoms, good gameplay decisions and a little luck have the potential to reward players with actual crypto tokens while they play a game they enjoy.

### Utility

Since both JEWEL and CRYSTAL can be used to mint new NFTs, the value of the tokens is linked by shared utility. This provides exciting arbitrage opportunities across blockchains and ensures that cross-chain expansion does not lead to a loss of value for older tokens. Future expansions are expected to follow the same strategy.

Additionally, JEWEL is used for gas fees on the [DFK Chain](broken-reference), where the gameplay transactions for Crystalvale take place.&#x20;

Specific information about each token can be found on the [JEWEL Token](broken-reference) and [CRYSTAL Token](broken-reference) pages and issuance schedules for each can be found on the [JEWEL Gardens](broken-reference) and [Ice Gardens](broken-reference) pages.

Additionally, each token may be exchanged at the Jeweler for governance tokens, and used to cast votes on major decisions when such votes are called. More information on governance votes can be found on the [Jeweler](broken-reference) page.
