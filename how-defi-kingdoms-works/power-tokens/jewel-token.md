### JEWEL Hard Cap

The JEWEL token has a hard cap of 500,000,000 tokens.

### Pre-minting

**10,000,000 JEWEL** tokens have been pre-minted and distributed as follows:

* **5,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated to fund the future development of the game. These tokens will be time-locked and released over a set schedule as features are completed.
* **2,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated for promotion of the project, including marketing, airdrops, etc. These tokens are also time-locked to release slowly over the next few years to ensure that there are always funds available to market the game and acquire new players and investors.
* **2,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated for initial liquidity. These tokens will be matched with ONE tokens to form the initial liquidity pool and will not be withdrawn or sold.
* **1,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated for bounties and hours for the founding team based on their work towards launch. Half of these will be awarded at launch, and the other half will vest over time.

### Multi-sig Wallet Treasury

**Our funds are secured in a multi-sig wallet at multisig.harmony.one.** These wallets will be controlled by 4 founding members of the project, and any transaction will require 3 out of 4 signatures to execute. This helps to protect against hacks that would target the treasuries, ensuring that there is no single point of failure. Additionally, this protects against any one member of the team having the power to do anything on their own, without the rest of the team being aware of and agreeing to it. It also gives 100% transparency, as anyone can view all of the transactions that are proposed before they are executed, as well as a history of every past transaction that was executed.

We know there has been concern with some other projects selling a large amount of tokens at launch that left some feeling frustrated in the project. We seek to help put these concerns at ease with these measures to help our community have confidence in the DeFi Kingdoms project.
