# Decentralized Exchange

At its heart, DeFi Kingdoms has two decentralized exchanges that use the tried-and-true UniswapV2 Protocol. DeFi Kingdoms: Serendale's DEX trades in JEWEL, ONE, and a host of tokens on Harmony, while DeFi Kingdoms: Crystalvale's DEX trades in CRYSTAL, AVAX, and a variety of tokens on Avalanche. Investing is one of the main reasons we are drawn to blockchain technology and we want to make the investing experience fun and enjoyable for all within the realms.

From the Marketplace, you can swap tokens at the current exchange rates. You can also become a Liquidity Provider by adding liquidity to any token pools youâ€™d like. These will earn you fees any time anyone trades those tokens. Additionally, these LP tokens can also be staked in the Gardens to earn JEWEL or CRYSTAL rewards.
