# The Gardens

At its core, the Gardens is a place to stake liquidity provider tokens to receive JEWEL tokens. You’ll be gaining JEWEL tokens to use in game for rare NFTs and other items JUST by staking! It’s a powerful part of the game, and really fun.

![Gathering the fruits of his labors.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aRXlckUEe4m-pjzvf4yGOfjWEI3wGaKkUfkibFTr0ajqytksCOG8EcyLwsymZ54ncsx_VdI5JH9p2NLi7y_zrSoJdCBcG9XiK2yGZnIYauHkVuO9_Ec73j1_UpYOSJ_T7ceWw1YY)

Our visualization on liquidity pool mining is unique and fresh. We’re building an epic world and gardens in which to represent token pairs and liquidity pool mining. Within each garden (i.e. LP pairing), you will be able to see your portion of the total share within the plot represented by your owned plants. The gardener busies himself with tending to your plants \(this represents the countdown timer between blocks mined\) and once harvested, the gardener deposits your yield in the storehouse representing your share of JEWEL tokens of the block mined. **There will be ways in which to augment and increase your yield by in-game items that will provide you with increased JEWEL token rewards!**

### Issuance Schedule
**The issuance of Jewel as rewards for staking LP tokens in the Garden is scheduled to change during each consecutive period of time, which we refer to here as an Epoch, depending on the Harmony Block Chain Speed so please take note of the starting block. The Epochs were calculated assuming a 2 seconds per block speed on the Harmony blockchain so that each Epoch would equal one week assuming a constant 2 seconds per block speed. Accordingly, if block speeds are longer than 2 seconds per block on average, each Epoch will take longer than a week, and inversely, if block speeds were less than 2 seconds, then an Epoch would last less than one week.**

You can visit the Harmony Blockchain Explorer at https://explorer.harmony.one at any time to see where the current block is and the current block latency, but note that block latency fluctuates and should be viewed on an average (i.e. daily or weekly basis) if trying to  plan your Garden farming strategies.

### Locking Model

_A portion of the JEWELs grown in the Gardens can be harvested immediately (i.e. are unlocked and immediately usable), while the rest are dispersed deep underground (locked). These locked JEWELs will slowly work their way upward and will be rewarded to the owners in time, but until unlocked cannot be used in any way (i.e. cannot be used for staking, providing liquidity, governance votes or any other in game transaction). Once claimed, locked tokens remain locked until the end of the 51st Epoch (approximately the end of July 2022 depending on Harmony block speeds) at which point such locked Jewel will begin to unlock ratably over the next year (fully unlocking by late July 2023). **Heroes can also be set to mine for these locked JEWEL tokens, unlocking them early.**_

To balance the amazing multipliers that early adopters that provide liquidity via the Gardens receive, our tokenomics include a locking model on the Jewel tokens received from providing liquidity. Whenever rewards are **CLAIMED** from the Gardens, a portion of the amount of Jewel tokens received as rewards for staking LP tokens in the Gardens will be unlocked (i.e. immediately usable to trade, buy, sell, stake in the bank) and the remainder will be locked. The allocation of Jewel between unlocked and locked amounts will depend on when the rewards are **CLAIMED**, not on when they are earned.

**Starting the first Epoch, 5% of any rewards claimed from the Gardens were unlocked and immediately accessible and 95% of rewards claimed from the Gardens were locked. The percentage of rewards CLAIMED from the Garden that are unlocked at the time of claiming such rewards will increase by 2% every Epoch until reaching 100% around July 15, 2022 (which assumes an average of 2 second per block speed on the Harmony blockchain and will change if Harmony Blockchain Speed is slower than 2 seconds per block).** 

So, for example, Garden staking rewards claimed during Epoch1 will be 5% unlocked, 95% locked; during Epoch2 any Garden rewards claimed will be 7% unlocked, 93% locked; during Epoch 3 any Garden rewards claimed will be 9% unlocked, 91% locked, and so on, until Epoch51, when no more locking of staked rewards will occur for newly claimed Garden rewards.

As noted above, the calculation of what portion of your rewards is locked vs unlocked only takes effect once you click the **CLAIM** button.

**One amazing and unique feature of Defi Kingdoms that sets us apart from any other DeFi exchange out there today is the ability for Heroes to mine for unlocked tokens, unlocking locked JEWEL tokens early based on their stats.**

Below are two simplified examples that show how the locking model works. For the sake of simplicity, the examples assume no recompounding of claimed rewards into additional LP positions and that player earned 100 Jewel in Garden rewards during Epoch 1 with the only change in Jewel earned per Epoch in subsequent periods being due to the reduced Jewel emission per Epoch. In both scenarios, 301.6 Jewel is earned, but the amount unlocked versus locked is different. This locking model provides players the opportunity to choose a strategy that suits their style and risk appetite.

**Illustrative Example A**: Rewards earned during each Epoch are claimed during each Epoch (and not reinvested).

* 10 Epoch Summary:
  * Total unlocked Jewel: **29.8** Jewel
  * Total locked Jewel: **271.8** Jewel (inaccessible until ~end of July 2022 unless unlocked earlier via Heroes)
  * Total rewards: **301.6** Jewel

* Lower unlocked Jewel over the sample period, but allows for use of and potential recompounding/reinvestment of unlocked Jewel during sample period.

**Early Unlocking**

One amazing and unique feature of Defi Kingdoms that sets us apart from any other DeFi exchange out there today is the ability for Heroes to mine for unlocked tokens, unlocking locked JEWEL tokens early based on their stats.

This locking model helps the project retain value for the long-term, and ensures only those who see the long-term vision of DeFi Kingdoms jump in and earn the maximized rewards available to early adopters. Further, this locking schedule both balances the rewards needed to attract early providers of the necessary liquidity against the long term interest of a sustainable price for an in game token and concurrently provides early stakers the choice to compound their staking rewards at the cost of locking more of their Jewel rewards or receive more unlocked tokens with the opportunity cost of missing out on compounding rewards.

As noted above, once claimed, locked tokens remain locked until the end of the 51st Epoch (approximately the end of July 2022 depending on Harmony block speeds) at which point such locked Jewel will begin to unlock ratably over the next year (fully unlocking by late July 2023). After the end of Epoch 51 (approximately end of July 2022) and we reach the point where 100% of gardening rewards claimed will be unlocked, all locked tokens previously claimed during the prior 51 Epoch’s that haven’t otherwise been unlocked through Hero mining quests will begin to unlock over the next year, so that by approximately the end of July  2023, all locked tokens will have been unlocked.

### **Garden Staking Deposit and Withdrawal Fees**

**There are no deposit fees for staking in the Gardens.** To protect against flash loans and pump and dumps, we do implement withdrawal fees for withdrawing staked LP tokens. The withdrawal fees are listed below.

* **0.01%** fee if a user withdraws after **4 Epochs**
* **0.25%** fee if a user withdraws after **2 Epochs but before 4 Epochs**
* **0.5%** fee if a user withdraws after **5 days but before 2 Epochs**
* **1%** fee if a user withdraws under **5 days**
* **2%** fee if a user withdraws under **3 days.** 
* **4%** fee if a user withdraws under **24 hours.** 
* **8%** fee if a user withdraws under **1 hour.**
* **25%** slashing fee if a user withdraws **during the same block.**
